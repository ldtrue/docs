## Welcome to TrueCall API Documentation

TrueCall provides a simple yet powerful API for accessing campaign and session data for your team. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and integrating with Truecall's API endpoints.

### Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token. Your API key serves as this token and is essential for accessing Truecall's API. Make sure to keep your API key secure and never share it with unauthorized users.

```json
"headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <api_key>"
  }

```
